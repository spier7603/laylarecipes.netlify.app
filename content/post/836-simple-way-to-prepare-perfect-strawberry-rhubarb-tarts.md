recipeinstructions:
- "Wash strawberries and hull them. Put into food processor along with a cup of sugar. Or… dice them, place in a bowl and stir in sugar."
- "Wash rhubarb and process through a mandolin. Don’t be a hero… fingertips are not one of the ingredients."
- "Combine the strawberry slurry and the rhubarb. Add to a pot on medium low heat. Add in corn starch and vanilla extract. Simmer for a while until completely dissolved and incorporated. Allow to cool completely. Now is a good time to start working on your dough… and probably preheat your oven to 375 F."

- "Your filling has to be cool to fill the pie crust. If not, it will start saturating it and making it saggy. If cooled, fill up the tarts."
- "Run your rolling pin along the perimeter of the tart pan after it is filled. Don’t do this before filling or the weight of the filling might suck the sides down. Top with crumble and place in the hopefully preheated 375 F oven."
- "Bake 40-50 mins or until bubbling and golden. Allow to cool COMPLETELY before serving."
