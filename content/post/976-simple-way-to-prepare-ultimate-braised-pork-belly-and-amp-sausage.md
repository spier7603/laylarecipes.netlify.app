- "By now, the sausage will have really started to flavor the broth. You can start preparing your pork belly."
- "Slice the pork belly in half lengthwise and then dice into large cubes. Add into pot. Stir."
- "Add in coconut milk and hot chili. Stir and continue simmering for an hour. If you want to speed things up, you can take the lid off to allow it to reduce. I chose to leave the lid on to let the sausage and pork belly become super tender."
- "Add in peeled boiled eggs. If at any point, you feel the liquid level is decreasing too much, add a touch of water to keep everything happy. Continue simmering uncovered while stirring occasionally."
- "Put sugar in a frying pan on medium heat along with molasses. Stir constantly until it caramelizes. Add to Pot. Simmer uncovered."
- "About an hour after adding that sugar and simmering uncovered, you’ll have something like this. By now, everything has been technically “done” hours ago. But by simmering slowly, the flavors are intensifying. I stopped here."
- "I ladled a bit over some rice and had some pickled celery with it. Took an eternity, but it was well worth it."
