recipeinstructions:
- "PREPARING THE MARINADE/DRESSING  Place the shallots and smashed garlic in a bowl.  Add a 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt and 3 tablespoons of grapeseed oil to the bowl, and toss everything together.  Heat the oven to 400°F.  Place the shallots and garlic in a pie plate, and roast for 30 minutes or until the shallots soften and caramelize.  Place the red wine vinegar, sherry vinegar, Dijon mustard, 2 teaspoons of kosher salt, and sugar in a blender."
- "Once the shallots and garlic are roasted, place them in the blender as well.  Blend all ingredients until smooth.  Remove the center piece from the blender lid. Keep the blender running while pouring in 1 cup of olive oil and 1 cup of grapeseed oil.  Once all of the oil is added, season to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Remove the Wagyu flat iron steak from packaging, and place it in a large Ziploc bag.  Pour half of the marinade/dressing over the steak, and close the b"
- "NOTE: Reserve the other half of the marinade/dressing. You will use this for the salad.  Gently massage the marinade into the steak, and refrigerate for 12-24 hours.  Before grilling the steak, take the steak out of the marinade, and allow it to sit at room temperature for 1 hour."
- "PREPARING THE SALAD  Add the kale, cherry tomatoes, capers, cucumber, halved Mozzarella balls, onions, bread cubes, red bell pepper, and yellow bell pepper to a large bowl.  Using the dressing/marinade that you made earlier, toss the salad with enough dressing to coat it well.  Let the dressing-coated salad sit while you heat the grill and grill your Wagyu flat iron steak. This will allow the bread and kale to soften."
- "FINAL STEPS  Heat a gas grill over medium-high heat for 10 minutes.  Once the grill is hot, grill the Wagyu flat iron steak for 3 minutes per side.  Let the steak rest for 10 minutes before slicing it against the grain into thin slices.  Toss the torn basil in with the salad, and divide the salad amongst bowls.  Top the salad with slices of grilled Wagyu steak, and drizzle each salad with a little more dressing.  Serve, and enjoy!"
