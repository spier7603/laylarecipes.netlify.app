recipeinstructions:
- "In large saute or fry pan, melt butter. While butter is melting, combine flour, salt and pepper in small bowl. Dip each piece of chicken in milk; shake off excess. Dredge chicken in flour mixture and add to fry pan. (I like to cut chicken breasts in half before coating.)  Saute chicken in butter over medium to medium-high heat until browned and cooked through, turning often. Add more butter as needed. (Be careful turning chicken so as not to break off any of the flour coating.)  Remove chicken from pan and place on platter. Keep chicken warm while making the sauce."
- "Turn heat to medium high and deglaze with the wine, stirring to get all of the brown bits off the bottom of the pan. Turn heat to medium low and continue to cook sauce, stirring frequently. Squeeze juice of 1/2 lemon through cheesecloth into sauce (add capers at this point if using them) and continue to stir until sauce has thickened slightly.  (Note: Sauce should be tasted frequently, and more wine or lemon can be added as necessary. If sauce does not thicken properly, add a little bit of flour and continue to stir.)  When sauce is ready, add chicken back to the pan and turn to coat."
- "For serving: Remove chicken to serving platter and top with any additional sauce, parsley sprigs and lemon slices."
