recipeinstructions:
- "PREPARING THE MASSAMAN CURRY PASTE  Place all the curry paste ingredients (seeded and diced Fresno chiles, diced onion, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, black pepper, minced garlic, diced lemongrass, minced ginger, shrimp paste, fish sauce, minced cilantro, kosher salt, palm sugar, lime juice, lime zest, and water) together in the bowl of a food processor.  Process until a smooth paste forms.  Set aside."
- "PREPARING THE WAGYU BEEF  Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Add in the grapeseed oil.  Make sure your Wagyu bottom round roast has been cut into 1 inch cubes.  In a large bowl, mix together the corn starch, kosher salt, black pepper, and Wagyu beef cubes.  Once the oil is heated in the Dutch oven, add in the Wagyu beef.  Let the beef cubes cook/brown for 4 minutes on one side.  Once browned, turn the Wagyu beef cubes over, and brown the other side for 4 minutes."
- "Once the beef cubes are crispy and browned, add in the Massaman curry paste.  Lower the heat to medium, and stir to coat the Wagyu beef cubes.  Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, while stirring occasionally.  Add in the beef stock, and bring to a boil.  Scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to get up anything stuck to the bottom.  Once you reach a boil, lower the heat to low. Cover the Dutch oven with a lid.  Simmer on low for 90 minutes."
- "PREPARING THE POTATOES  After the Wagyu beef cubes, curry paste, and beef stock have been braising for 90 minutes in the Dutch oven, add in the halved potatoes and coconut milk.  Cover, and let everything simmer for 30 minutes longer."
- "PREPARING THE RICE  In a medium saucepan, heat the water and kosher salt over medium-high heat.  When the water comes to a boil, stir in the jasmine rice.  Once the water comes back to a boil, reduce the heat to low.  Cover the saucepan with a lid.  Cook for 20 minutes on low heat or until the water has evaporated.  Fluff the rice with a fork. Reserve."
- "FINAL STEPS  Season the Wagyu beef massaman curry to taste with kosher salt, lime juice, and palm sugar.  Serve the dish with jasmine rice, and garnish with cilantro leaves, sliced Fresno chiles, and lime wedges.  Enjoy!"
