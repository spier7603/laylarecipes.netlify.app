recipeinstructions:
- "Lay the pork shoulders in a large pot and add enough water to submerge them by a few cm. Add a large pinch of salt and turn the heat up to medium. Bring to a simmer. Skim the surface occasionally to remove any gunk and fat that collects on the surface. After 1 hr, add the chicken, and extra water as needed to keep the meat submerged. Simmer another 20 minutes, then remove all the meat to a plate. Do not discard the braising liquid."
- "Once cooled a bit, de-bone, trim, and chop the pork into large chunks (about 2 to 3 cm). If using chicken drumsticks, you can also clean them up and remove the nubby ends."
- "Add a splash of veg oil to a medium saute pan on medium-high heat. Throw in the pork and fry for about 3 minutes until browned. Remove the pork and add the chicken. Fry for about another 3 minutes. Return the pork to the pan with the chicken."
- "Pour the braising liquid into the pan. Add the garlic, peppercorns, soy sauce and bay leaves. Let simmer for about 2 minutes, then add the pineapple juice and rice vinegar. Simmer uncovered for 30 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked, the pork is fork tender, and the sauce is reduced by at least half and slightly thickened. Serve on top of freshly steamed rice."
