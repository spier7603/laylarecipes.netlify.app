recipeingredient:
- "1/3 cup melted coconut oil"
- "1/2 cup maple syrup or honey"
- "2 eggs room temperature"
- "1 cup packed mashed overripe bananas about 3 bananas"
- "1/4 cup milk"
- "1 teaspoon baking soda"
- "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
- "1/2 teaspoon salt"
- "1/2 teaspoon cinnamon plus more for sprinkling"
- "1 3/4 cup fine wholemeal flour"
- "1/3 cup old fashioned rolled oat"
- "1 teaspoon turbino or raw sugar for sprinkling on top i omitted this one"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius). If necessary, grease all 12 cups of your muffin tin with butter or non-stick cooking spray (my pan is non-stick and didn’t require any grease)."
- "In a large bowl, beat the coconut oil and maple syrup together with a whisk. Add the eggs and beat well. Mix in the mashed bananas and milk, followed by the baking soda, vanilla extract, salt and cinnamon"
- "Add the flour and oats to the bowl and mix with a large spoon, just until combined. If you’d like to add any additional mix-ins**, like nuts, chocolate or dried fruit, fold them in now."
- "Divide the batter evenly between the muffin cups, filling each cup about two-thirds full. Sprinkle the tops of the muffins with a small amount of oats (about 1 tablespoon in total), followed by a light sprinkling of sugar (about 1 teaspoon in total). Bake muffins for 22 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean."
- "Place the muffin tin on a cooling rack to cool. You might need to run a butter knife along the outer edge of the muffins to loosen them from the pan. These muffins will keep at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. They keep well in the freezer in a freezer-safe bag for up to 3 months (just defrost individual muffins as needed)."
