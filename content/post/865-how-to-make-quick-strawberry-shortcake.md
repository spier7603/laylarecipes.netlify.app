- " Strawberries"
- " Flour"
- " Heavy Whipping Cream  12 Cup"
- " Sugar  15 Tbs"
- " Butter  1 Tbs"
- " Baking Powder"
- " Grated Nutmeg"
- " Salt"
- " Vanilla Extract"
- " Lemon Juice"
- " Powdered Sugar Optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash and prep strawberries. You can slice and dice them any which way you want, but I prefer this look."
- "Put 3/4 of the strawberries into the bowl. Gently crush the remaining 1/4 of the strawberries and added them to the bowl. Add in 1/3 cup sugar and stir. Cover and wait for the miracle."
- "Add all dry ingredients to bowl. The remaining, sugar, the salt, the nutmeg, flour, baking powder and so on. Add in 1 room temp stick of butter and 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream. Combine until you achieve a crumbly dough. If you need a splash of cream or pinch of flour, adjust. Knead just until it is ball formation."
- "Roll out dough no less than a 1/4 inch in thickness. I would say between 1/4 and 3/8 inch is good. Cut an even amount of biscuits and place them on a greased cookie sheet or a silicone mat. You can cut shapes if you feel fancy. You can make extra biscuits or cookies with the scrap dough."
- "Melt the remaining butter and brush the tops of all the biscuits. Stack them by 2 as seen below. Bake in a 400 F oven until golden. Roughly 12-15 minutes."
- "While the biscuits are baking, whip the 1 1/2 cups of cream (and powdered sugar if you’d like) until it just begins to become stiff. Then, add in the vanilla extract and the lemon juice. Whip again until stiff. Move to the fridge."
- "After the biscuits are done, pull them apart. Brush with a little bit of butter. You will notice that the magic has occurred with the strawberries. Begin spooning some of them onto the first biscuit, then the top biscuit. Top with a healthy amount of cream and even put some on the side if need be. There should be no problem utilizing leftover cream. Serve immediately."
