- "Wash the tomatoes and cut them in a half. Put them in the blender."
- "Take out the sundried tomatoes from their jar, discard extra oil, and... add them in the blender."
- "Pit your olives and... you know."
- "Chop the equivalent of a third of a butter stick worth of parmesan in rough pieces (no need to grate it because...)."
- "Add 4 tablespoon of your best olive oil, a generous pinch of salt, your chilis and..."
- "BLEND! Until the pesto is a grainy paste. Sometimes chunks of parmesan, garlic or walnut escape the blender, fish around with a spoon and keep blending until the bigger chunks are gone."
- "Taste the pesto and add salt, pepper and olive oil to your taste."
- "To use with pasta The key here is DON&#39;T COOK THE PESTO it will change the flavours. Boil the pasta and mix it with your beautiful raw pesto in a serving bowl, not on a pan or on the stove."
- "To freeze  Pesto will freeze beautifully and keep for a long time. To unfreeze it, let it rest outside the fridge for a few hours. To speed up the process, you can chop the pesto into pieces with a knife (it&#39;s usually pretty soft)."
- "To preserve in the fridge Transfer your pesto in a tall jar, and level out its surface. Then completely cover the pesto&#39;s surface with a layer of your best olive oil (this will prevent the pesto from oxidizing)."
- "To play with this recipe Increase the amount of basil (four times) and don&#39;t use olives or sun-dried tomatoes for a more classic green pesto. Add chives, ramps (!!), or fresh parsley for variations on herbaceous flavors. Substitute walnuts for cashews for a creamier buttery taste or almonds for a drier fresher take. Take out the fresh tomatoes and double or triple the amount of olive oil for a more traditional Italian version (too heavy on the vegetable fats for me, but deeeeelicious)."
