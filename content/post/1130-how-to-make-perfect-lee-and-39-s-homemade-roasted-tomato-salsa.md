recipeinstructions:
- "Roast in the oven at 365&#39; for 50-60 minutes. Turning all peppers over every now and then, to blister the skins evenly. You want everything to be nice and blistered and carmalized in color."
- "Place all your vegetables on a rimmed sheet pan. Cut the tops off of the garlic bulbs. Drizzle everything with olive oil. Liberally season everything with salt and cracked black pepper."
- "Let vegetables cool to the touch. Slip the skins off of the tomatoes and peppers if desired. Take ribs and seeds out of the Jalapeños, for a milder heat. Leave in for a more intense heat. Put everything in a blender, and puree to desired consistency. Squeeze the roasted garlic out of their skins, and add as well. You will most likely need to blend everything, in at least two separate batches."
- "Pour all blended ingredients into a large non reactive stockpot. Add tomato juice, ground cumin, desired sugar, salt, and fresh lime juice. Bring to a low simmer for 30 minutes uncovered. Add the fresh chopped cilantro during the last 5 minutes. Be sure and taste during the entire cooking process. Adjust seasoning as needed for you taste."
- "Serve warm or well chilled. Alwats tastes better the next day.. Will keep in the refrigerator for several weeks. Enjoy!"
- "This can easily be processed, and canned. I do not recommend doing this, unless you are very experienced at canning."
