recipeingredient:
- " Italian sausage"
- " can of tomato basil and garlic pasta sauce I used Reganno brand from Aldi"
- " can of red pesto sauce I used Priano brand from Aldi"
- " About 4 cups of dried rigatoni pasta I used Priano brand from Aldi"
- " ricotta cheese"
- " Spinach fresh I used about a half of a box from Aldi"
recipeinstructions:
- "Brown the sausage in a cast-iron skillet"
- "Set oven to broil to preheat"
- "Start your rigatoni- add a little salt to the water- and cook for about seven minutes. It should NOT be fully cooked"
- "In a separate sauce pan, combine sauces, and then once sausage has finished cooking, add to sauce mixture. * bonus add-ins: finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes, and fresh basil"
- "When noodles have not quite finished cooking, drain and pour about half into cast-iron skillet, stir and sauce and spinach (spinach will wilt and condense with heat). Gradually add the rest of the noodles. There should be enough sauce in the skillet to retain enough moisture to finish cooking the pasta- so stop adding pasta if it looks like the sauce is too sparse."
- "Dollop about 1/2 cup of ricotta cheese around the mixture, and gently fold in (It’s ok if it is not fully mixed)"
- "Flatten out with a spatula and cover with a light layer of mozzarella cheese"
- "Put cast-iron skillet in the oven on broil for about 7 minutes or until cheese starts to brown on high spots. Time may vary depending on how hot your skillet was or if you are using a glass pan instead"
- "Enjoy!!"
