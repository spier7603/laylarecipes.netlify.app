recipeinstructions:
- "Make your pasta dough (Or use Boxed) and start getting your salted water gradually up to a boil. While resting dough and waiting for water, give your sausages a couple of shallow slits. Get a pan hot over medium heat and place your sausages in. Let them cook reasonably slow so they can brown and you can prep your onion and pepper."
- "When your sausage has nicely browned, throw in your onions and a splash of canola oil. Season well. Cook them down a little and add the pepper. Cook a few minutes. Deglaze with red wine, cook out alcohol for a minute and add 1/3 cup water. Reduce to low and cover."
- "You should be ready to boil your pasta. Add the olive oil, cheeses and 2-4 Tbs. of black pepper (Your Discretion). Mash the life out of it until it becomes a paste. (Go back to the sausage and throw the cherry tomatoes in. Cook on low until liquid is gone). When your pasta is just about al dente, add in a ladle of pasta water. Mix. Add another ladle."
- "After sauciness is achieved, put your pasta on top. This will seem hopeless for the first 30 seconds. Don’t give up. With tongs, grab pasta and stir the freak out of the pasta until you see it becoming thick and creamy. You’ll see melted cheese. You’re home."
