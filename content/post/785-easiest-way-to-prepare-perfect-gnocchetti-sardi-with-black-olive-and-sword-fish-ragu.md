Shaped traditionally on the lines of wicker baskets and more commonly now on gnocchi Squid ragu first grabbed my attention at the now (sadly) closed Koffman&#39;s. Pierre Koffman&#39;s squid ragu was deeply savoury. This gnocchetti sardi recipe is everything I want in comfort food (Kerrygold butter and cheese), and is a little unexpected I&#39;ve paired the sauce with some delightfully chewy gnocchetti sardi (also known as malloreddus), a hand-formed Sardinian pasta that&#39;s. Gnocchetti Sardi are much smaller than regular gnocchi but still preserve shell like shape.

This gnocchetti sardi recipe is everything I want in comfort food (Kerrygold butter and cheese), and is a little unexpected I&#39;ve paired the sauce with some delightfully chewy gnocchetti sardi (also known as malloreddus), a hand-formed Sardinian pasta that&#39;s. Gnocchetti Sardi are much smaller than regular gnocchi but still preserve shell like shape. Because of external streaks and inner cavity they become rich and perfectly flavored with the sauce. Traditionally they are one of the main pasta dishes in Sardinia during, festivals. The name &#34;gnocchetti sardi&#34; with which people outside of Sardinia refer to this kind of pasta is a reference to its shape.
