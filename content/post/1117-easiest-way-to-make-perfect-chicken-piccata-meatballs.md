recipeingredient:
- "1 lb ground chicken"
- "1 egg"
- "3/4 cup breadcrumbs"
- "6-8 garlic cloves minced"
- "1/3 cup fresh parsley or handful of dried"
- "1/2 cup parmesan cheese grated"

- "3/4-1 cup lemon juice"
- " Salt  pepper"
- "2 cups chicken stock"
- "1 tsp better than bullion"
- "2 cup heavy cream"
- " Drained capers to taste"
recipeinstructions:
- "For the meatballs: Place Meatball ingredients in a bowl and mix to combine. If it’s too wet to form balls, add a touch of extra breadcrumbs or refrigerate.  Scoop up a heaped tablespoon and with slightly wet hands, roll into balls.  Heat oil in a non-stick skillet over medium high heat. Add half the meatballs and cook for 4 minutes, browning all over but still raw inside. Remove onto a plate, repeat with remaining meatballs."
- "Sauce: Wipe skillet clean with paper towel. Reduce heat to medium.  Melt butter in skillet, then add flour. Mix and cook for 1 minute, then add lemon juice, chicken broth and cream.  Bring to simmer then add meatballs. Simmer for 5 minutes or until sauce thickens and meatballs are cooked through. Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Stir through parsley and capers. I like serving this with pasta with more parmesan cheese!"
- "Note:To make this with milk instead of cream, just add an extra 1 tablespoon of flour into the butter, plus add 2 tablespoons of grated parmesan into the sauce. This will thicken the sauce nicely, it will taste fantastic and is a healthier option!"
