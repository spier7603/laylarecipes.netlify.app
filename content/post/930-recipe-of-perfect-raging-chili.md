- "Add in Hamburger and Onions to your sauteed mixture. Cook while often stirring to help break up the meat as well as ensure it does not burn. Cook until only about 10-15% remains pinkish in color.   If worried you can cook until all is browned but do not overcook to where parts burn."
- "Place ALL Peppers inside of an ice bath. You will be able to separate the blistered skin from the body at this point. You are looking for a slick to the touch exterior. If it feels crispy or leathery it needs removed still.   Deseed the appropriate Peppers and chop to desired size.   BEWARE seeds from the Bell Peppers MUST be removed or they can cause an upset stomach. Seeds of the Serrano Peppers can remain."
- "Combine ALL ingredients into a 6+ quart crockpot. Be careful when stirring as it will be full.   Allow mixture to cook, covered, for 10-14 hours on a low heat. Stir the chili mixture occasionally."
