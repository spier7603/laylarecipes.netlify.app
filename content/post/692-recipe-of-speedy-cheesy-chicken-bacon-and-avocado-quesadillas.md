- "1/2 cup scallions diced"
- "8 slice bacon cooked  crumbled"
- "1 avocado peeled cored and diced"
- "1 mild cheddar cheese shredded"

recipeinstructions:
- "Arrange bacon on a cooling rack (like for cookies) and set it on top of a baking sheet. If you don&#39;t have a cooling rack, you can just put the bacon straight on the sheet. Or in a 9x13 baking dish. Either way will work. Place bacon in a cold oven and turn heat to 400°F. Cook for 15 minutes per side."
- "Add 1/2 tbsp bacon drippings to a skillet over medium heat. Add scallions and saute about 2-3 minutes until softened. Add the chicken in a single layer, season with salt and pepper, and cook for about 5 minutes or until chicken is golden and cooked through, flipping just once during cooking. Remove the chicken and scallions to a place and rinse out the skillet."
- "Add about 1/2 tbsp butter to the skillet over medium heat. When foamy, add tortilla and swirl it around to get it nice and buttery. Layer one side of the tortilla with chicken, bacon, avocado, and a little cheese. Use tongs to flip the other half of the tortilla over and press down. Cook the tortilla for about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy."
- "Repeat with the rest of the tortillas, adding a little more butter for each tortilla as needed. Eat &amp; enjoy!"
