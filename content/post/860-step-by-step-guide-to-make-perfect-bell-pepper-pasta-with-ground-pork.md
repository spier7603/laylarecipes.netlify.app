recipeinstructions:
- "To remove the skin of the pepper, coat with a touch of oil and then place in the oven and cook until the skin starts to char slightly, moving the pepper around until evenly charred all the way around. You don‚Äôt need too much char for this. Once charred, place in a bowl and cover in plastic wrap and let it steam for 15 minutes. Using your knife, scrape the skin off the pepper, remove the seeds and stem, and cut them into thin slices."
- "Bring a pot of salted water to a boil along with a large frying pan on medium high heat. Add olive oil and get the onions in first to get them going. Season with salt and once softened and begins to turn translucent, add the bell peppers. Cook for a few minutes until the onions are fully translucent and soft and starting to brown slightly. Add the garlic, chili flakes and cook until the garlic softens and begins to slightly brown around the edges."
- "Mix tomato paste into the vegetables and cook for 2-3 minutes. Next add heavy cream, lower the heat to medium and cook for about 5 minutes or until the cream has thickened. Let cool slightly and then blend until smooth. Set aside 1 cup of sauce or more for this meal and reserve the rest in a jar. You know you will come back to it soon enough üòÅ"
- "Once the salted water starts boiling, throw your choice of pasta in."
- "While pasta is almost cooked, fry the ground pork with salt and pepper until light brown color in the same frying pan on medium heat. Add the sauce back to the pan and get it on a lower heat, mix all together."
- "Then 1-2 minutes before the pasta is perfectly cooked, add it to the sauce with a tablespoon or two of the pasta water, marry the sauce, the meat and the pasta until the pasta becomes perfectly al dente. Turn the heat off, toss in some grated parmesan until creamy and thickened. Enjoy!"
