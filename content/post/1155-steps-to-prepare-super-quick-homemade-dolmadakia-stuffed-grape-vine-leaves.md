recipeingredient:
- "1 1/2 cup Short grain white rice"
- "300 grams GrapeVine leaves 50 leaves"
- "2 medium size finely chopped Onions"
- "1 cup finely chopped Parsley"
- "1 cup finely chopped Dill"
- "1 1/2 cup Olive Oil"
- "2 Lemon juices"
- " Salt"
- " Pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start off with the Grape/Vine leaves, if you are able to find fresh leaves at the farmers market, then that is great. All you need to do is boil them just so slightly for about 3 minutes, just so that they are easy to fold. If your not able to find fresh leaves, then the store bought ones do just fine, all you have to do is strain completely. I am not able to find fresh leaves either, so I always use store bought jars."
- "Ok, next step is to take the sauce pan and add 1/2 cup olive oil, toss in the onions and stir for 5 minutes. Add in the rice and 2 cups of water, stir continuously so that it does not become one big blob. ðŸ™‚ Boil for 10 minutes on low heat Set aside In a large bowl add in the Parsley, Dill and the rice mixture."
- "Ok, this is really simple, I mean the rolling part. Place one leaf on your work surface, shiny side down, add one tablespoon or teaspoon (depending on how large the leaf is) in the middle. Then just turn in both sides of the leaf, take the bottom part of the leaf and start to roll upwards, this will turn out to look into a log."
- "Take the large sauce pan and start by putting the Dolmathakia in a circle until finished. I have to invest in some new sauce pots and pans. The ones I have at the moment are so old and not very helpful. ðŸ™‚ Anyway, if you have any rice mixture left over after rolling the logs, I usually add it into the sauce pan."
- "Add the rest of the Olive Oil, Salt, Pepper, Lemon Juice and Water just enough water to cover the Dolmadakia. Add a small plate on top to hold them down while boiling and this also helps the logs not to fall apart. Boil for 50 minutes..leaves and rice should be done by now. If not add a bit more water and let them boil until soft. These appetizers are eaten cold, and are delicious dipped in Yogurt and or Tzatziki. More than happy to help anyone who might try this recipe."
