recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to bake at 350F."
- "Prepare a muffin tin by buttering 12 muffin cups."
- "Place small circles of parchment paper (or muffin liners) in the bottom of each cup. (I cut out circles from parchment paper and used a small measuring cup and traced around it.) the butter is supposed to make the paper stick to bottom of muffin tray. You can use the muffin liner but doing it with the circle liner on the bottom way you will get a tiny crisper bit of a crust which we want on the outside."
- "Add 1 tsp (5ml) of flour into each muffin cup and coat. Tap out any extra. Flick it around using your fingers."
- "In a large mixing bowl, add BC Sour Cream, sugar, BC Canola Oil, BC Egg, and vanilla and whisk until well combined."

- "Fill muffin tin cups 50%."
- "Bake cakes for 12 – 14 minutes (just do 2 minute intervals after the 12 minutes if it needs longer timing), or until a cake tester comes out clean."
- "Allow to cool for 5 minutes before removing cakes from the pan. Then allow to cool for at least 10 minutes more on the rack. But it would be better if it completely cools."
- "Scald BC Cream by heating cream in a small pot on the stovetop on low heat until you start to see some steam. Approximately 1-2 minutes. Do not boil."
- "Meanwhile, add hot cream to chocolate and mix with a stainless-steel spoon until fully melted and combined."
- "Level out all cakes (cut off bulging muffin tops). Place 1 tbsp (15 ml) strawberry preserves* on half of the cake."
- "Take the remaining half of the cakes and invert them on top of the others so that the preserves are in the middle."
- "Place a sheet of parchment paper underneath a wire rack on the counter. Place mini cakes on the wire rack."
- "Evenly pour desired amount of ganache on top of each cake."
- "Gently remove the coated cakes to a tray and refrigerate for 10 minutes"
- "Garnish as desired. Serve with BC Vanilla Ice Cream."
- "Raspberry, blueberry, or your other favourite preserves can be used as a substitute for strawberry preserves. I had some tart cherry in the fridge and it was really great."
- "Eat within 1 to 2 days. These freeze nicely. Use leftover cut off muffin tops for a trifle."
