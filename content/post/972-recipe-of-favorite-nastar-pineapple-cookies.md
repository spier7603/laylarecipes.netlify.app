recipeinstructions:

- "Pineapple jam: Grate the pineapple or blend with a food processor. Transfer the shredded pineapple and its juice along with cinnamon stick and cloves into a heavy-bottom pan. Cook over medium heat and stir occasionally until the liquid is gone."
- "Add sugar and continue cooking until it has a thick jam consistency but with no liquid. Keep stirring towards the end so it does not burn."
- "Remove from the pan and cool it to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (up to a week). It will become easier to handle and less sticky."
- "Divide the pineapple jam evenly into 32 pieces (6g each). Roughly roll each into a ball. Refrigerate until needed."
- "Cookie dough: Using an electric mixer, cream the butter and margarine together for 1 minute on medium speed. Add sugar and beat for another minute just to combine."
- "Add egg yolk and mix briefly for 10 seconds. Then sieve the custard powder and flour into the bowl. Mix until it forms a uniform dough. If the dough feels sticky, add a little more flour (1 teaspoon at a time). Add butter if it&#39;s dry. It should be easily formed into a ball without crumbling or sticking."
- "Divide the dough into 32 pieces (8g each). Shape each into a ball."
- "Press the ball in between your palms to make a thin disk. Place 1 piece of pineapple jam on the center. Wrap it and pinch the edges closed. Roll it back into a ball and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Repeat with the rest."
- "Bake in a preheated oven at 300°F (150°C) for 30 minutes. Let cool completely on a wire rack before applying egg wash for the second bake."
- "Egg wash: Whisk together all of the ingredients to fully combine."
- "Brush each of the cookies with the egg wash. After the first coat has set, apply a second coat. These multiple coats will conceal any visible cracks and create a shiny yellow crust."
- "Return into the oven at 325°F (160°C) and bake for 10-15 minutes until slightly brown. Let cool then enjoy!"
