- "You can either deep fry the chicken or bake it. I chose to bake mine. Bread chicken with egg and chicken fry seasoning. Roll the roulades in fry seasoning, then egg, then back into fry seasoning. Either place in a greased baking dish for baking, or on a plate if frying. If baking, bake at 375 for 40 - 50 minutes. If frying, fry in 350 degree oil for 6-8 minutes. Either way chicken needs to reach 160 degrees internal temperature."

Let rice absorb most of the liquid before adding more. When you add the last cup of broth, add butter and pecorino. Stir until risotto has a smooth consistency and the rice is tender."
- "Whether you deep fried or baked the chicken, when it reaches 160 degrees internal, add the sliced cheese on top. Place in the oven on broil until the cheese becomes bubbly and just starts to brown."
- "Plate the risotto. Add the chicken roulade on top. Drape a few sprigs of asparagus over and garnish with a lemon wedge. The lemon is meant to be squeezed over the entire dish. Serve immediately. Enjoy."
