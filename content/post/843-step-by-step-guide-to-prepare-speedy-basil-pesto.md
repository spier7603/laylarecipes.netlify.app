Later, you can pop these out and melt them in a pan and then add your Parmesan cheese to taste."
- "If you want to enjoy some fresh pesto, add the cheese (not the full amount - eyeball it based on how much you froze) and mix it in the food processor. If you didn&#39;t opt to freeze, slowly add in your olive oil while mixing. Scrape down the sides to get all the ingredients mixed in well."
