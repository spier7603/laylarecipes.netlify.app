recipeinstructions:
- "In a medium-sized bowl, add coconut milk, drained pineapple juice, and crushed pineapple, whisk to combine. Blend mixture for 30 seconds. Skip blending if you like a chunkier pineapple texture."
- "Add sweetener of your choice, depending on how you like your popsicles. Stir or blend for 15 seconds to combine."
- "Add chia seeds to the mixture. Stir until combined, and allow to sit at room temperature for 15 minutes.
