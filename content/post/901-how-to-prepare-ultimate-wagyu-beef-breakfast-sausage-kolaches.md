recipeinstructions:
- "PREPARING THE WAGYU BEEF BREAKFAST SAUSAGE AND ONION MIXTURE  Heat a Dutch oven or heavy-bottom sauce pan over medium-high heat.  Add in the grapeseed oil, and heat until slightly smoking.  Add in the Wagyu beef breakfast sausage in small pieces. Use a wooden spoon to break up large pieces.  Cook the breakfast sausage until browned.  Then, add in the minced sweet onion, and stir.  Cook for 3 minutes or until the onions are translucent, while stirring occasionally."
- "Add in the minced garlic, and cook for 1 minute longer.  Add in the butter, and stir. Cook until the butter has melted.  Sprinkle in the flour, and stir to coat the breakfast sausage.  Cook for 3 minutes while stirring constantly.  Lower the heat to medium, and slowly stir in the milk.  Stir constantly until the mixture thickens.  Then, add in the heavy cream, minced thyme leaves, kosher salt, and crushed red pepper.  Season to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper."
- "Place the sausage and onion mixture in a 9x13 casserole dish, and cool in the refrigerator for 1 hour.  NOTE: You can also cool the mixture in the refrigerator overnight. If you are leaving it in the refrigerator overnight, cover the casserole dish with plastic wrap.  Make the dough while the Wagyu beef breakfast sausage and onion mixture is cooling."
- "PREPARING THE DOUGH  In a large bowl, mix together the flour, instant yeast, and sugar.  Add in the warmed milk, softened butter, and eggs.  Mix with a wooden spoon (or a dough hook if using a stand mixer) until the dough comes together.  Then, add the kosher salt.  Start kneading the dough with your hands for 5 minutes or until the dough is smooth and elastic.  Cover with plastic wrap, and let bulk ferment for 50 minutes.  Once the dough has bulk fermented, remove the plastic wrap."
- "Divide the dough into 16 equal portions. Round each portion.  Cover the dough balls with plastic wrap, and gather two parchment paper-lined baking sheets and a pastry brush.  Prepare your egg wash (1 egg whisked together with 1 tablespoon water)."
- "PREPARING THE KOLACHES  Pull the sausage and onion mixture from the refrigerator after it has cooled.  Working with two dough balls at a time, roll each dough portion into a long oval shape (approx. 10 inches x 4 inches).  Place a 1/4 cup of the breakfast sausage and onion filling down the center of the dough.  Use a pastry brush to lightly brush the edges of the dough with the egg wash.  Working lengthwise, stretch the dough over the filling, and seal the edges together."
- "Then working with the ends (top and bottom), pull each end towards the center. Seal them over the already sealed edges.  Place the kolaches seam-side-down on the parchment paper-lined baking sheet.  Brush the egg wash on top of the kolaches.  Repeat the process with remaining dough until all of the kolaches are assembled."
- "FINAL STEPS  Once the Wagyu breakfast sausage kolaches are all assembled, let them proof for 15 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 375°F.  Cook the kolaches for 20 minutes or until the tops are golden brown.  Pull them from the oven, and let them cool for 15 minutes before serving.  Serve warm, and enjoy!"
