recipeinstructions:
- "PREPARING THE FULLBLOOD WAGYU SIRLOIN TIP STEAK  Place the Fullblood Wagyu steak slices, 1 tablespoon of grapeseed oil, and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil in a medium size bowl.  Sprinkle the cornstarch over the steak slices, and mix everything together.  Reserve."
- "PREPARING THE SAUCE  Place all of the sauce ingredients (soy sauce, dark soy sauce, oyster sauce, fish sauce, and corn starch) in a small bowl.  Mix well, and reserve."
- "PREPARING THE RICE  In a medium size sauce pan, add the water and kosher salt.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Stir in the jasmine rice, and bring to a simmer.  Cover the sauce pan with a lid, and reduce the heat to low.  Cook for 20 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender.  Remove the rice from the heat, and keep it covered until ready to serve.  While the rice is cooking on the stove, prepare the stir fry."
- "PREPARING THE STIR FRY  Heat a large wok over medium-high heat.  Add in 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil.  Once the oil is slightly smoking, add the Wagyu steak slices to the wok in a thin layer.  Let the beef brown for approximately 2 minutes. Then, flip the steak slices, and brown the other side.  Remove the steak slices from the wok (place them on a plate), and leave the oil in the wok."
- "Add the seeded and julienned red bell pepper and the julienned sweet onion to the wok.  Cook over medium-high heat until the onions start to brown and the peppers soften.  Add the minced garlic to the wok, and cook for 1 minute longer.  Add the steak slices back to the wok.  Add the sauce to the wok as well.  Stir fry over medium-high heat for 1 minute.  Fold in the basil leaves, and turn off the heat."
- "FINAL STEPS  Fluff the rice with a fork, and divide the rice between bowls.  Top the jasmine rice with the Thai basil Wagyu beef stir fry.  Garnish with cilantro leaves, serve, and enjoy!"
