This dip can be made up to 2 days in advance."
- "PREPARING THE FULLBLOOD WAGYU ITALIAN SAUSAGE Heat a large sauté pan on medium-high heat with 2 tablespoons of grapeseed oil. Add the Fullblood Wagyu sweet Italian sausage in small pieces to the pan. Break up the sausage with a wooden spoon into smaller pieces as it cooks. Once cooked, drain off the fat and allow the sausage to cool."
- "PREPARING THE PIZZA SAUCE Heat a stainless steel pan on medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of grapeseed oil to the pan. Add the minced sweet onion, and sauté until translucent with a little bit of caramelization. Deglaze the pan with the red wine. Using a wooden spoon, scrape up any of the bits left on the bottom of the pan. Once the wine has reduced, add the crushed tomato, minced garlic, dried basil, dried oregano, kosher salt, and freshly ground black pepper."

Prepare two parchment-lined baking sheets, and heat the oven to 400°F.Twist each long, thin strip of filled dough. Be sure to hold each end carefully (so the toppings don’t fall out) and twist in opposite directions. Place the pizza twists on the baking sheets with one inch of space between each twist."
- "Repeat the above steps with the second piece of dough until all pizza twists have been created."
- "FINAL STEPS Bake the Fullblood Wagyu Italian sausage and pepperoni twists for 20 minutes or until they’re nice and golden brown. Serve the twists warm with the spicy herb dip. Enjoy!"
