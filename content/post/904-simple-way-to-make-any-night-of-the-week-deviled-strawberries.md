recipeingredient:
- " large strawberries"
- " package of cream cheese softened"
- " heavy whipping cream"
- " sour cream"
- " white granulated sugar"
- " graham cracker crumbs"
- " vanilla extract"
- " fresh lemon juice optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prep the strawberries by cutting off the stems and slicing them in half. Next, cut a small sliver off of the back of each strawberry half so that they sit up straight. Then use a small melon baller to carefully hollow out the middle (you don&#39;t need to take out much, just make a small enough indent so that the cream cheese filling doesn&#39;t slide off)."
- "Place the softened cream cheese, sour cream, sugar, vanilla extract and lemon juice in a medium sized mixing bowl (DO NOT add the heavy whipping cream). Beat with an electric mixer until smooth."
- "In a different medium sized mixing bowl, beat the whipping cream until stiff peaks form (about 5 minutes)."
- "Fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture until well incorporated."
- "Fill a piping bag with the cream cheese mixture (I used a star tip), and pipe it onto each sliced strawberry."
- "Finish with a sprinkle of graham cracker crumbs. Serve and enjoy!"
- "Notes-The number of strawberries you need to match the amount of cream cheese mixture really depends on the size of the strawberries. I bought a large container of medium sized strawberries from Costco, and still ended up with a bit of leftover cream cheese mixture. You CAN make the cream cheese mixture (including whipped cream) the day before. My leftovers were the perfect consistency the next day. I may or may not have been eating it with a spoon."
- "The strawberries can also be cut and prepped the day before, just be sure to place them in an air tight container with a paper towel so that they don&#39;t get soggy or end up with that weird refrigerator taste."
