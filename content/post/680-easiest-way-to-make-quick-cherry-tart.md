recipeinstructions:
- "Put all ingredients for crust in a bowl except the water. Use a wire pastry masher, fork, food processor or mixer to completely blend the dry ingredients with the flour. SLOWLY begin to add the cold water while mixing. Once the dough comes together and can hold its shape, it’s done. Wrap and place in fridge."
- "Half and pit the cherries. You can wear gloves… if you’re scared. Hahaha! It looks like I was doing an oil change. I wasn’t expecting that."
- "Put the cherries and all filling related in a large bowl. Fold everything together being careful to keep the integrity and shape of the cherries. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside."
- "Preheat the oven to 400 F. Roll out 3/4 of your dough until it’s large enough for your tart pan. Stab the bottom surface of the tart with a fork. Be sure to press the dough into the edges of the pan so you get the tart effect around the perimeter."
- "Run your rolling pin along the top of the pan and peel off the excess dough. Place parchment paper in the bottom of the pan and put about a pound of dry beans in it. Bake for 11 minutes. Roll out the other portion of dough and cut some fun shapes out."
- "Take the cherries out of the bowl and put in another bowl. Simmer the remaining syrup for 5 minutes. It will thicken with the corn starch being in it. Toss cherries with the reduced syrup and add to tart. Top with your shapes. Give them an egg wash and sprinkle with sugar. Place in oven at 375 F for 40-45 mins. Place a cookie sheet underneath to catch drippings. Check intermittently."
- "Remove from oven and allow to cook completely before even thinking about cutting it. It’ll take a few hours."
- "When the tart has cooled considerably, top with chiffonade of mint. Do it when cooled, otherwise it’ll wilt."
- "If you have a removable bottom, run a sharp knife along the side of the tart pan to break the sugar bonding the tart to the pan. Remove and cut for serving."
