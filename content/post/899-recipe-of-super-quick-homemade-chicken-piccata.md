recipeinstructions:

- "Cut each chicken breast into 2 thinner slices. Place in between saran wrap and use a meat tenderizer to pound it very thin. It will plump more once it’s cooked so pounding thin is key."
- "Pat the chicken dry and dredge each side in the flour mixture. Tap off excess"
- "Heat 3 Tbsp. olive oil and 1 Tbsp. butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken in batches for 3-4 minutes per side, until a golden crust has developed. Add a splash of olive oil and/or reduce heat as needed during cooking. Set the chicken aside on a plate and turn off heat when finished."
- "Carefully wipe the pan, but leave a few brown bits for added flavor."
- "Add the wine and garlic. Set heat to medium. Bubble gently for 4-5 minutes, until just a small amount of liquid remains. Use a silicone spatula to “clean” any remaining brown flecks on the pan while the wine reduces. This will add flavor."
- "Add the capers, chicken broth, 2 Tbsp. lemon juice and stir to combine."
- "Add the chicken along with any juices from the plate."
- "Add the chicken along with any juices from the plate."
- "Spoon the sauce over the chicken and cover partially, cook for 3-5 minutes. The sauce will thicken slightly and become more flavorful."
- "Reduce heat to low. Add 2 Tablespoons cold butter and let it melt into the sauce. Tilt the pan to distribute the sauce throughout and spoon it over the chicken again. Remove from heat."
- "Garnish with parsley and serve"
- "In a different pan, sauteé red onions and garlic for 3 minutes on medium heat. Add spinach and 1/2 a Tablespoon of salt. Cook spinach until wilted then set aside to cool and serve."
