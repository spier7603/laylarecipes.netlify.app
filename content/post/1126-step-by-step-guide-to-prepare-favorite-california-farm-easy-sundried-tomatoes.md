- " Olive oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash, quarter tomato, leave skin on, lay with cut side towards noon sun. An old Amazon cardboard box works great. Sprinkle mineral containing salt to taste, sparingly. Remember, dried tomatoes will taste saltier than fresh ones. After two days, spin tomatoes so other cut side faces the south sun. Cover with insect cloth, 40” x86”, the size of a large door, called magnetic screen door at Amazon, $14."
- "After four days, turn dried tomatoes bottom up in the sun for an hour till totally dry, pack loosely in paper bags, fold and close top to insects, hang in dark closet."
- "Sundried tomatoes are fantastic for cooking. Select your best dried tomatoes to put up in olive oil. Submerge in certified Californian or Spanish or Tunesian extra virgin olive oil, pure, no multi country mix. The minerals in the rock salt sprinkled on the tomatoes, especially zink, have been researched in Spain to help preserve the olive oil for two years."
