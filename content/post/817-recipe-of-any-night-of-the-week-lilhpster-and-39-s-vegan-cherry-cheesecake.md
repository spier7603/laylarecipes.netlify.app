- "Make the cheesecake. Warm the vegan cream cheese in the microwave for a bit so that it is soft."
- "Combine the vegan cream cheese, your previously prepared vegan condensed milk, lemon juice, and vanilla in a mixing bowl."
- "Blend the mixture until its smooth. Poor and spread it over your pie crust. Chill in the fridge for about an hour or so until it sets up and firms a bit."
