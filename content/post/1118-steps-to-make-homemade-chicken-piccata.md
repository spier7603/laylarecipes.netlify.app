recipeingredient:
- "4 boneless skinless chicken breasts about 1 pounds halved horizontally Tip Freezing the chicken breasts for 15 minutes will make slicing them through the middle easier"
- " Kosher salt and black pepper"
- " Allpurpose flour for dredging"
- "6 tablespoons unsalted butter"
- "3 tablespoons extravirgin olive oil plus more as needed"
- "1 shallot peeled and sliced lengthwise"

- "3/4 cup chicken stock"
- "4 teaspoons drained capers"

recipeinstructions:
- "Season both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper. Dredge the chicken in flour and shake off any excess."
- "In a large skillet, heat 3 tablespoons butter and the olive oil over medium-high heat until the butter has melted. Working in batches to avoid crowding the pan, add the chicken and sauté until golden brown and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side."
- "Remove the chicken, place on a plate and repeat with the remaining pieces, adding more olive oil if needed."
- "Once the chicken is cooked, add the shallot and lemon slices to the pan and sauté, stirring occasionally, until lightly caramelized and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the stock and simmer until reduced by half, about 3 minutes."
- "Reduce the heat to low, then stir in the remaining 3 tablespoons butter, capers and lemon juice, to taste. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the chicken with the sauce poured over the top. Garnish with parsley if desired."
- "Serve with a starch — pasta, polenta, rice or white beans — for sopping up the sauce, and a green vegetable."
