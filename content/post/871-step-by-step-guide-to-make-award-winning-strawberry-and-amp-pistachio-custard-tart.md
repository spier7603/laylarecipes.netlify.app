- "Take the disk out of the fridge and press it lightly to soften. You should leave your disk on a counter for 10-20 mins to soften if it&#39;s too firm. Roll it out into 3 mm (0.1&#39;&#39;) thick while coating it lightly with bread flour. Wind the pastry around a rolling pin and lift."
- "Place the pastry on the pan gently and line the pan with it. Trim the edges. Press the side of the pastry against the pan."

- "Cook it again over medium heat while mixing. After it becomes heavy like 1st picture below, cook it for another 2 mins. To prevent scorching, mix it while scraping off the cream on the bottom and the corners of the pot. Cook it until large bubbles appear. Turn off the heat and mix it lightly."
- "Add unsalted butter and mix well until combined. Strain it and then put it in the tart crust and flatten it. Seal the top of the custard with plastic wrap and chill it in a fridge for 2-3 hours."
- "【STRAWBERRY JELLY】Put 1.5 Tbsp water in a small container. Sprinkle gelatin powder over the water. (You should put water first and then sprinkle gelatin over to prevent unevenness.) Leave it until you use. Cut frozen strawberries into small pieces. Put them into a pot. Add granulated sugar and lemon juice."
- "Cook it over medium heat for 5-6 mins until it gets softened. Turn off the heat and add the gelatin. Melt the gelatin thoroughly. Add rum and mix well. Strain it and let it cool for about 5 mins."
