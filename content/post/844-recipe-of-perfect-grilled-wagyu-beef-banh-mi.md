Make the pickled slaw and sriracha mayo at this time."
- "PREPARING THE PICKLED SLAW  Place the peeled and julienned carrot, julienned daikon, jalapeno (cut into coins), and sliced garlic in a medium size bowl.  In a small saucepan, heat the water, vinegar, sugar, dried red peppers, and salt over medium heat.  Once the sugar and salt have dissolved, pour the mixture over the vegetables in the medium size bowl.  Let the pickled slaw sit in the refrigerator for 30 minutes."
- "PREPARING THE SRIRACHA MAYO  In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise and sriracha.  Mix well, and set it aside."
- "FINAL STEPS  Preheat your oven to 350°F.  Once the Wagyu beef has marinated, heat a gas grill over medium-high heat for 10 minutes.  Once the grill is hot, place the Wagyu beef strips horizontally across the hot grates.  Grill each strip for 30 seconds on each side (the beef strips are thin, so they don’t take too long)."
- "Warm the cut French rolls in the preheated oven for 3 minutes.  Spread the sriracha mayo on the inside of the warmed rolls, and top each roll with 4 pieces of grilled Wagyu beef.  Top the beef with the pickled slaw, and garnish with sprigs of cilantro.  Serve immediately, and enjoy!"
