recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the pineapple jam.  Peel the pineapple with a sharp chopping knife.  Divide into 4.  Separate the core from the pineapple.  Finely chop the pineapple and core."
- "Place them on a strainer to drain out excess juices and liquid.  Set aside for about 15mins.  You should have 750g worth of chopped pineapples.  If you do not have the exact weight, calculate and adjust the rest of the ingredients accordingly."
- "Taste your pineapple before cooking.  If the pineapple is sweet, use less sugar.  If the pineapple is tang, use more sugar.  In a skillet over medium heat, add the chopped pineapple."
- "Transfer cinnamon, cloves and star anise into an empty tea bag.  Seal tightly and add into the skillet.  Saute until aromatic.  Add in sugar and maltose."
- "A quick tip. Maltose syrup is difficult to work with at room temperature. After measuring out, transfer to a heat proof bowl and let steam for about 5 mins or until the maltose is liquify.*"
- "Stir well to combine. Stir, stir, stir.  Continue stirring until the pineapple jam is dry and sticky. It should take about 15 to 20 mins.  Add in desiccated coconut and coconut rum."
- "Be careful when adding in the rum, as flame might be ignited in the hot skillet.*  Continue sauteing until the pineapple jam is slightly caramelized.  Lastly, add salt.  Taste and adjust for sweetness and tang."
- "If it is too sweet, add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.  If it is too tang, add more sugar and season lightly with salt.  Remove from heat.  Set aside to cool down completely."
- "On a side note, you can add a cup of water to deglaze the skillet. Bring it up to a simmer. Transfer into a cup. Add in a tea bag. You have a fine pineapple tea.*"
- "While the pineapple mixture is cooling down, prepare the dough.  In a mixing bowl, sift together cake flour and milk powder.  Add in salt and stir to combine well.  In another large mixing bowl, using a fork, cream butter until light and fluffy."
- "Add in sugar and cream until well combined.  Add in egg.  Lightly whisk until the mixture is light and creamy. Whisk, whisk, whisk."
- "Add 1/3 portion of the flour mixture.  Using a spatula, fold in the flour mixture into the butter mixture.  Keep folding until mixture is well combine.  Repeat this process until all the mixture is combine and come together as a dough."
- "Transfer onto a cling film.  Wrap and let it firm up in the fridge for at least 40 mins to an hr.  After the pineapple jam has cooled down.  Measure 15g for each portion."
- "Roll each portion into a ball and place them on a plate.  Cover with cling film and let it firm up in the fridge at least an hour."
- "Assemble the shortcake.  Preheat oven to 170 degrees celsius or 340 fahrenheit.  Divide the dough in half and place the other half in the fridge until ready to use.  Measure 15g for each portion."
- "Roll each portion into balls.  Follow the above directions and photos in shaping the shortcakes or you can check out my Instagram highlights.  *Note that the butter in the dough will melt very fast. If you find that the dough is difficult to work with, dust some flour, roll into a ball and shape again.*"
- "After shaping each shortcake, place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.  Repeat the process until all the shortcakes are shaped.  Lightly brush the shortcakes with egg wash with a pastry brush."
- "Wack into the oven and bake for 10 mins.  Remove from oven and flip the shortcakes.  *It is best to flip the shortcakes with 2 spatula. They are at its most vulnerable stage, so treat them with tender love and care,*"
- "Brush with egg wash.  Wack into the oven and bake for the final 8 to 10 mins or until it is golden yellow.  Remove from oven and let cool completely before serving.  The shortcakes taste better the next day."
