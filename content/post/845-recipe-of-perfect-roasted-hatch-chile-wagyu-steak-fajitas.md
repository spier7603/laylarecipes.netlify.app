recipeinstructions:
- "PREPARING THE HATCH CHILE SAUCE  Heat your oven to 425°F.  Place your washed and dried hatch chiles on a baking sheet.  Roast the hatch chiles for 6-7 minutes until the skins start to brown and blister.  Then, use tongs to turn the chiles over. Roast them for an additional 6-7 minutes.  Then, place the chiles in a bowl, and cover it with plastic wrap. Allow the chiles to sit in the covered bowl for 20 minutes.  In a small saute pan, add 2 tablespoons of grapeseed oil."
- "Cook the julienned yellow onions and smashed garlic on medium heat until the onions are translucent.  Once the chiles (in the bowl) have cooled, peel the skin off. Discard the seeds and stems.  Place the peeled and seeded chiles in the blender along with the cooked onions and garlic.  Add the chicken stock, lime juice, kosher salt, and chopped tomatoes to the blender as well.  Blend until smooth, and season to taste with kosher salt. This is your hatch chile sauce."
- "PREPARING THE GUACAMOLE  After peeling and pitting one avocado (or two small avocados), mash it in a small bowl.  Then, fold in the remaining ingredients – minced red onion, minced garlic, kosher salt, lime juice, and minced cilantro.  Season to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Reserve."
- "PREPARING THE FAJITAS  Place your Wagyu beef for fajitas in a large bowl.  Pour 1 cup of the hatch chile sauce over the fajita beef in the bowl. Stir to coat.  Let the fajita beef marinate for 30 minutes.  Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.  Add in 3 tablespoons of grapeseed oil, and heat until slightly smoking.  Once the oil is hot, add in the marinated fajita beef.  Let it sear for 3 minutes on one side. Then, turn to sear the other side."
- "Remove the fajita beef from the skillet, and add in 3 tablespoons of grapeseed oil.  Add the julienned sweet onions and poblano peppers to the skillet, along with a 1/4 cup of chicken stock.  Cook until the onions are translucent and the peppers are tender.  Add the seared fajita beef back into the skillet (with the onions and peppers).  Add 1 cup of the hatch chile sauce to the skillet as well.  Cook over medium heat for 2-3 minutes until warm."
- "FINAL STEPS  Serve the roasted hatch chile Wagyu steak fajitas with corn tortillas, crumbled queso fresco cheese, and fresh guacamole.  Enjoy!"
