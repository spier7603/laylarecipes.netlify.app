recipeinstructions:
- "Salt and pepper the filets, and let them sit while your pan heats up."
- "Heat a large frying pan on medium high heat. When hot add a tbs olive oil and add beef. Sear to golden brown on all sides and both ends."
- "When done, brush mustard all over beef and put in the fridge to chill."
- "Next start on the doxoulle. Add mushrooms, garlic and shallots to a food processor. Pulse until everything is chopped into very fine pieces."
- "Add this to the same pan the beef was cooked in, along with another tbs olive oil, and the fresh herbs. Saute until mixture starts to brown and most of the moisture is cooked out of it."
- "Next add the red wine to the mushrooms. Let all of the liquid reduce until doxoulle is like a paste. Season to taste with salt and pepper."
- "Meanwhile, turn out pastry onto a lightly floured surface. Roll out to about 1/8 inch thick. Lightly Sprinkle flour on top as needed. When done, lay pastry out on the same floured surface. Beat 2 eggs, and egg wash all of the tops of the pastries."
- "Spread the doxoulle over about 3/4 of the pastry. Leave a bare edge on 3 sides so the pastry will seal."
- "Completely wrap the filet with prosciutto. Place on top of the doxoulle. Roll the pastry up around the beef. Use your fingers to seal the seam. Twist the ends to tightly seal the ends. Cut off excess pastry."
- "Wrap wellington in a large sheet of saran wrap. Roll it and twist the ends tight to form the shape of the wellington. Refrigerate for 45 minutes."
- "Preheat oven to 425. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove saran wrap and place wellingtons on the baking sheet. Score tops to let them vent. I tried to do a herring bone pattern. With the beaten eggs, egg wash the outside of all with a brush."
- "Place in oven at 425 for 20 minutes. Then reduce heat and bake until a thermometer reads 125 in the middle of the filets. When checking temperature poke the thermometer in the ends. The pastry should be golden brown. This could take another 30 to 45 minutes."
- "Remove wellingtons from the oven and tent with foil. Let rest for 5 to 8 minutes."
- "Slice in half and serve. This should come out medium rare. Enjoy."
