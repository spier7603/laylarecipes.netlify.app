1. Get  extra virgin olive oil
1. Make ready  garlic cloves
1. Get  salt


I&#39;ve used it to top a pizza crust, or some focaccia. I&#39;ve grown basil for years in my garden in the summer, but it&#39;s only been in the last couple of years that I&#39;ve planted enough to be able to use end of the season plants to make this amazing Italian Basil Pesto with Pine Nuts. Sure I&#39;ll buy some from the market in a pinch, but nothing compares to the do it. When I get the basil home it either goes into a glass vase with water, until I get around to using it, or the roots get trimmed and the whole plant gets submerged in cold water and swished around so that the detritus and grit falls away.
