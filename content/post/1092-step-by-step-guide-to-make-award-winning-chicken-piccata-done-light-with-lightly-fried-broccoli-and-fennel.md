recipeingredient:
- "1 tbsp olive oil extra virgin for veggies"
- "5 head broccoli reduced to florets and chunks"
- "3 stick fennel chopped coarsely"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "1 tsp ground black pepper"
- "1 tsp garlic powder"
- "4 large chicken breasts"
- "3 large eggs"
- "1 tsp salt for chicken"
- "1 tsp ground black pepper for chicken"
- "1 tsp garlic powder for chicken"
- "2 large lemons just zest"
- "3 tbsp olive oil extra virgin for chicken"
- "3 clove garlic minced finely"
- "1/2 cup dry white wine"
- "1 1/2 cup chicken broth"
- "2 large lemons just juice"
- "5 tbsp capers optional"
- "1 handful parsley chopped optional"
- "1 large lemon halved and sliced thin optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat a very large saucepan worth the tablespoon of oil,  and heat on medium high."
- "When up to temp,  add the broccoli and fennel,  carefully sprinkling and mixing in the salt,  garlic powder,  and pepper.   The florets trap the seasonings,  so you really can&#39;t be dumping the spices in,  or certain florets will have all the spices."
- "Stir in the spices,  and let simmer a bit.   You want to brown the veggies a little,  and then stir and repeat."
- "Slice the breasts down the middle, and then, using parallel cuts, cut three layers out of each half."
- "In a separate bowl add the breasts, eggs, and chicken seasonings and zest, stir,  and let marinate until all egg is incorporated."
- "When the veggies are browned to your taste,  and still a little crisp,  remove the veggies from the pan,  and warm on a dish in the oven at about 170°F."
- "Add the additional oil to the former veggie pan and sear the marinated chicken on both sides until both sides have a nice egg-induced mottled brown-gold color, which should pretty much cook it through.  Remove to a separate serving plate, and keep warm."
- "Reduce heat to low, wait a moment, and when down to temp, toss in the garlic."
- "When the garlic is in there a minute or so,  deglaze with the wine,  and stand back, then stir."
- "Let the wine cook off for a couple minutes,  and then add the chicken broth and lemon juice."
- "Reduce the mixture to desired consistency,  and add salt to taste."
- "Plate 2 pieces of chicken next to the veggies,  and spoon some broth over the top of the chicken."
- "Garnish with parsley, capers, and lemon slices,  if you like,  and serve immediately.   Thin strips of chicken will dry quickly."
- "I would pack leftover chicken,  if any,  in the broth to keep it moist."
